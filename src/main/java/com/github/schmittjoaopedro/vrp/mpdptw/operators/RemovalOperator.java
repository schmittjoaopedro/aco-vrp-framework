 * a solution. The number "q" of requests to remove is drawn between limits established in Section 4, while we set

     * from the solution. The nodes of r are removed from the solution and the request r is stored inside the set of
     * removed requests R. Finally, the removal loop occurs. A request r is randomly selected in R. Assigned requests
     * from S are put inside the set o assigned requests S and sorted accordingly g(). A random number between 0 and 1
